# TerraformVPC

Create a terraform template for AWS VPC. We will use this VPC later for running our workloads
A template should contain the following resources:
- VPC
- At least two public subnets
- At least two private subnets
- Internet gateway
- At least two NAT gateways
- Public route table
- Private route table

You should be able to launch a virtual machine in a private subnet, establish an SSH connection to it, and download updates from the internet.

The code should be uploaded to a repository on GitHub.
